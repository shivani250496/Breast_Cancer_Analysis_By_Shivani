Breast Cancer Analysis

* Tumors are classified into two categories
* 1 M
* 2 B
* These classification is based on the anlysis of the characterstics of cyst or tumor.

Now What is EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the method of studying and exploring record sets to apprehend their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables. EDA is normally carried out as a preliminary step before undertaking extra formal statistical analyses or modeling.


Steps of EDA in our project:

Step1: installation of libraries(matplotlib, xgboost, scipy) numpy and pandas are already installed in my device.
Step2: importing all essential libraries
Step3: reading of csv file(dataset)
Step4: Data preprocessing
Step5: Separate columns into smaller dataframes to perform visualization
Step6: Data visualization
Step7: Splitting the data
Step8: Model Building

Here are some Conclusive points from this model

1.Logistic Regression accuracy : 58.77%
2.SVC accuracy : 58.77%
3.Naive Bayes accuracy : 59.65%
4.Random Forest Classifier accuracy : 95.61%
5.XGboost accuracy : 98.25%
